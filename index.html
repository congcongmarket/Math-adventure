                            This iPad app was designed to make learning math fun and engaging for children.
                            The client required a gamified app design that would help young learners,
                            primarily in grades 1-3, improve their math skills. The app features two modes:
                            lesson watching and quiz answering, with the overall experience presented in the form of island-themed levels.
                            After watching video lessons, children can progress through levels by answering questions and earning rewards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given the target audience of younger children,
                            we employed a design with large rounded corners to create a more friendly and approachable interface.
                            Additionally, all the cards and icons within the app were designed with 3D effects to enhance the gaming experience.
                            For key buttons, we combined icons with text to accommodate the fact that young children might have limited reading skills,
                            ensuring that the app remains intuitive and easy to navigate.
                        </p>

                            This project showcases our ability to create an educational app that balances learning with play,
                            ensuring that the design is both child-friendly and visually engaging.
                            By focusing on user experience and incorporating game-like elements,
                            we successfully delivered a product that not only meets the educational goals
                            but also keeps young users motivated and entertained.
